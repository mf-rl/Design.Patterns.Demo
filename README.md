## 🛠️ Design Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Abstract Factory:** Produces families of related objects.
- **Builder:** Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype:** Clones existing objects.

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge:** Decouples abstraction from its implementation.
- **Composite:** Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Decorator:** Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **Flyweight:** Shares common state across many objects to save memory.
- **Proxy:** Controls access to another object.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
- **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Interpreter:** Implements a grammar to interpret sentences.
- **Iterator:** Provides a way to access elements sequentially.
- **Mediator:** Centralizes communication between objects.
- **Memento:** Captures and restores an object's state.
- **Observer:** Allows objects to be notified of state changes.
- **State:** Allows an object to change its behavior when its state changes.
- **Strategy:** Selects an algorithm at runtime.
- **Template Method:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm.
- **Visitor:** Adds new operations to classes without modifying them.
