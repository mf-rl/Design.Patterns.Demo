# State Pattern

## Overview

**Definition:** The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class by delegating state-specific behavior to separate state objects, eliminating complex conditional statements.

**Intent:** Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class by encapsulating state-specific behavior in separate state classes and delegating operations to the current state object.

## How This Code Implements the Pattern

This implementation demonstrates the State pattern's essential structure with three key participants:

**Context:**
- **ExampleContext**: Maintains a reference to the current state object and delegates state-specific requests to it. The context provides the interface for clients and manages state transitions by allowing state objects to change the current state when appropriate conditions are met.

**State Interface:**
- **IState**: Defines the interface that all concrete state classes must implement. It declares the `Handle()` method that encapsulates state-specific behavior, ensuring that all states can process requests uniformly while providing their own unique implementations.

**Concrete States:**
- **StateA & StateB**: Implement specific behaviors for different states and handle state transitions. Each state class encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state of the context and determines when and how to transition to other states based on the requests they receive.

The pattern eliminates complex conditional logic by distributing state-specific behavior across separate state classes. Each state object handles requests according to its specific rules and can trigger transitions to other states, creating a clean and maintainable state machine implementation.

## Benefits Demonstrated

**Elimination of Complex Conditionals**: The pattern removes large conditional statements (if-else or switch) that would otherwise be needed to handle different states, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each state class focuses on handling the behavior for one specific state, creating clear separation of concerns and making individual states easier to understand and modify.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: New states can be added without modifying existing state classes or the context, making the system extensible while keeping existing components stable.

**State Encapsulation**: State-specific behavior and transition logic are encapsulated within individual state classes, promoting better organization and reducing coupling between different state behaviors.

**Dynamic State Transitions**: States can determine their own transition logic based on current conditions, enabling flexible and context-aware state management without centralizing all transition logic in one place.

**Explicit State Representation**: Each state is represented by a distinct class, making the state machine structure explicit and easier to understand, debug, and maintain compared to implicit state representations.

**Simplified Context Logic**: The context class remains simple and focused on delegation, without needing to understand the specifics of each state's behavior or transition rules.

## Usage

**User Interface State Management**: Managing different modes in applications such as text editors with insert/overwrite modes, drawing applications with different tool states (pen, eraser, selector), or media players with play/pause/stop states where each mode handles user interactions differently.

**Protocol State Machines**: Implementing network protocols or communication systems where different protocol states (connecting, connected, disconnected, error) handle incoming messages and commands according to their specific rules and transition to appropriate states based on protocol specifications and network conditions.
