# Visitor Pattern

## Overview

**Definition:** The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates by separating algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

**Intent:** Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. The Visitor pattern lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates, promoting separation of algorithms from data structures.

## How This Code Implements the Pattern

This implementation demonstrates the Visitor pattern's essential structure with four key participants:

**Visitor Interface:**
- **IVisitor**: Defines the visitor interface with overloaded `Visit()` methods for each type of concrete element. This interface establishes the contract that all concrete visitors must follow and uses method overloading to provide type-specific operations for different element types.

**Concrete Visitor:**
- **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the visitor interface and provides specific operations for each element type. Each `Visit()` method contains the algorithm logic for processing a particular element type, enabling the visitor to perform different operations based on the element's concrete type.

**Element Interface:**
- **IElement**: Defines the element interface that declares the `Accept()` method. This method takes a visitor as a parameter and establishes the contract that all concrete elements must follow to participate in the visitor pattern mechanism.

**Concrete Elements:**
- **ElementA & ElementB**: Implement the element interface and provide the `Accept()` method that calls the appropriate visitor method. Each element's `Accept()` method performs double dispatch by calling `visitor.Visit(this)`, which ensures the correct visitor method is called based on the element's concrete type.

The pattern uses double dispatch to determine both the visitor type and element type at runtime, enabling type-specific operations without using conditional statements or type checking. The visitor pattern separates operations from the object structure, allowing new operations to be added by creating new visitor implementations.

## Benefits Demonstrated

**Separation of Algorithms from Data**: Operations are separated from the data structures they operate on, allowing algorithms to be modified or extended without changing the element classes, promoting better code organization.

**Easy Addition of New Operations**: New operations can be added by creating new visitor implementations without modifying existing element classes, supporting the Open/Closed Principle for operation extension.

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Element classes focus on their data representation and structure, while visitor classes focus on specific operations, creating clear separation of concerns.

**Type-Safe Operations**: The pattern provides compile-time type safety through method overloading, ensuring that operations are properly matched to element types without runtime type checking.

**Centralized Operation Logic**: Related operations can be grouped together in a single visitor class, making it easier to understand and maintain complex algorithms that operate across multiple element types.

**Polymorphic Dispatch**: The pattern enables polymorphic behavior where the same operation interface can be applied to different element types while executing type-specific logic for each element.

**Consistent Operation Interface**: All operations follow the same visitor pattern structure, providing consistency and predictability in how new operations are implemented and used.

## Usage

**Abstract Syntax Tree Processing**: Implementing compilers or interpreters where different operations (code generation, optimization, type checking, pretty printing) need to be performed on various node types in an abstract syntax tree without modifying the node classes themselves.

**Document Object Model Operations**: Processing complex document structures where different operations (rendering, validation, transformation, analysis) need to be applied to various document elements (paragraphs, tables, images, headers) while keeping the document structure classes focused on data representation rather than processing logic.
