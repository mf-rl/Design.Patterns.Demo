# Strategy Pattern

## Overview

**Definition:** The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it by extracting algorithms into separate classes and making them interchangeable through a common interface.

**Intent:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The Strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it, promoting flexibility and eliminating conditional statements for algorithm selection.

## How This Code Implements the Pattern

This implementation demonstrates the Strategy pattern's essential structure with three key participants:

**Strategy Interface:**
- **IStrategy**: Defines the common interface that all concrete strategies must implement. It declares the `Execute()` method that establishes the contract for all algorithm implementations, ensuring they can be used interchangeably by the context.

**Concrete Strategies:**
- **ConcreteStrategyA & ConcreteStrategyB**: Implement the strategy interface with specific algorithm variations. Each strategy encapsulates a particular algorithm or behavior, providing different implementations of the same operation while maintaining the same interface contract.

**Context:**
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates algorithm execution to it. The context provides the interface for clients and can switch between different strategies at runtime through the `SetStrategy()` method, enabling dynamic algorithm selection without changing the context's core logic.

The pattern creates a composition relationship where the context uses strategies rather than inheriting from them, allowing algorithms to be selected and changed at runtime. This design eliminates the need for conditional statements to choose between different algorithms and promotes loose coupling between the context and algorithm implementations.

## Benefits Demonstrated

**Algorithm Interchangeability**: Different algorithms can be swapped at runtime without modifying client code, providing flexibility to adapt behavior based on changing requirements or conditions.

**Elimination of Conditional Logic**: The pattern removes complex conditional statements (if-else or switch) that would otherwise be needed to select different algorithms, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: New strategies can be added without modifying existing context or strategy code, making the system extensible while keeping existing components stable.

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each strategy class focuses on implementing one specific algorithm, while the context focuses on managing strategy usage, creating clear separation of concerns.

**Composition Over Inheritance**: The pattern favors composition over inheritance, avoiding the inflexibility and complexity that can arise from deep inheritance hierarchies for algorithm variations.

**Runtime Algorithm Selection**: Strategies can be chosen dynamically based on runtime conditions, user preferences, or configuration settings, enabling adaptive and configurable behavior.

**Testability Enhancement**: Each strategy can be tested independently, and mock strategies can be easily created for testing the context logic, improving overall system testability.

## Usage

**Sorting and Search Algorithms**: Implementing different sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort) or search strategies that can be selected based on data size, performance requirements, or memory constraints. The same data structure can use different algorithms without changing its core implementation.

**Payment Processing Systems**: Managing different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer, cryptocurrency) where each payment strategy handles its specific processing logic, validation rules, and integration requirements while presenting a uniform interface to the e-commerce system.
