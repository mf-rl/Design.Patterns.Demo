# Proxy Pattern

## Overview

**Definition:** The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The proxy acts as an intermediary that can add additional behavior such as lazy loading, access control, caching, or logging without changing the original object's interface.

**Intent:** Provide a placeholder for another object to control access to it. The proxy can perform additional operations before or after forwarding requests to the real object, enabling features like lazy initialization, access control, and resource management.

## How This Code Implements the Pattern

This implementation demonstrates the Proxy pattern's essential structure with three key participants:

**Subject Interface:**
- **IImage**: Defines the common interface that both the real object and proxy must implement. This ensures that the proxy can be used interchangeably with the real object, maintaining transparency for client code.

**Real Subject:**
- **RealImage**: Represents the actual object that performs the core functionality. It handles the expensive operation of loading an image from disk during construction and provides the actual display functionality. This is the object that the proxy is designed to control access to.

**Proxy:**
- **ProxyImage**: Acts as a surrogate for the real image object, implementing the same interface while adding control logic. It demonstrates lazy initialization by deferring the creation of the expensive RealImage object until it's actually needed. The proxy stores minimal state (filename) and creates the real object only when the first operation is performed.

The pattern achieves controlled access through the proxy's ability to intercept method calls and decide when and how to delegate to the real object. In this case, the proxy implements lazy loading by creating the real image only when Display() is first called, then reusing the same instance for subsequent calls.

## Benefits Demonstrated

**Lazy Initialization**: Defers expensive object creation until absolutely necessary, improving application startup time and reducing unnecessary resource consumption when objects might not be used.

**Resource Management**: Controls when and how expensive resources are allocated and accessed, preventing wasteful resource usage and enabling more efficient memory and performance management.

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: The proxy handles access control and initialization logic, while the real object focuses solely on its core functionality, creating clear separation of concerns.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Additional proxy behaviors can be implemented without modifying the real object or client code, making the system extensible while keeping existing components stable.

**Transparency**: Clients interact with the proxy through the same interface as the real object, making the proxy completely transparent and allowing seamless substitution without code changes.

**Performance Optimization**: Reduces unnecessary operations by controlling when expensive processes occur, leading to better overall system performance and responsiveness.

**Caching Capability**: The proxy can implement caching mechanisms to avoid repeated expensive operations, further enhancing performance for frequently accessed resources.

## Usage

**Virtual Image Loading**: In image viewers or web browsers where images should only be loaded from disk or network when they become visible or are explicitly requested. The proxy holds metadata (filename, URL) while deferring the actual image loading until display time, improving application responsiveness.

**Remote Service Access**: Managing connections to remote web services or databases where the proxy handles connection establishment, retry logic, authentication, and error handling. The proxy can implement connection pooling, automatic reconnection, and failover mechanisms while presenting a simple interface to clients.
