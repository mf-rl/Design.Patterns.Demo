# Factory Method Pattern

## Overview

**Definition:**  
The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Intent:**  
The intent of the Factory Method pattern is to delegate the instantiation logic to subclasses, enabling a class to defer instantiation to its subclasses and promote loose coupling in code.

## How This Code Implements the Pattern

This code demonstrates the Factory Method pattern by defining an abstract `Creator` class with an abstract `FactoryMethod` responsible for creating `Product` objects. Concrete subclasses (`ConcreteCreatorA` and `ConcreteCreatorB`) override the `FactoryMethod` to instantiate specific product types (`ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB`). The client code interacts with the `Creator` interface and calls the factory method, without needing to know the concrete product classes being instantiated. This separation of product creation from product usage is the essence of the Factory Method pattern.

## Benefits Demonstrated

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The creation logic is encapsulated within the creator classes, separating it from the product usage logic.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** New product types can be introduced by adding new creator subclasses without modifying existing code.
- **Loose Coupling:** The client code depends only on the abstract interfaces, not on concrete implementations, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
- **Scalability:** The pattern makes it easy to introduce new product families with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

## Usage

- **UI Component Libraries:** When building a UI framework, different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) may require different button or window implementations. The Factory Method allows the framework to instantiate the correct component for each platform without changing the client code.
- **Logging Frameworks:** A logging library can use the Factory Method to create different types of loggers (e.g., file logger, database logger, event logger) based on configuration or runtime conditions, allowing for flexible and extensible logging strategies.
