## 🛠️ Creational Patterns
**Focus:** How objects are created.

**Purpose:**
- 🎯 Hide the instantiation logic.
- 🧩 Provide flexibility in what is created.
- 🚪 Make object creation independent from specific classes.

**When to Use:**  
When object creation is complex, repetitive, or needs to be tightly controlled.

**Examples:**
- [Singleton](https://github.com/mf-rl/Design.Patterns.Demo/tree/master/Design.Patterns.Demo/1.Creational/A.Singleton/README.md)
- [Factory Method](https://github.com/mf-rl/Design.Patterns.Demo/tree/master/Design.Patterns.Demo/1.Creational/B.FactoryMethod/README.md)
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/mf-rl/Design.Patterns.Demo/tree/master/Design.Patterns.Demo/1.Creational/C.AbstractFactory/README.md)
- [Builder](https://github.com/mf-rl/Design.Patterns.Demo/tree/master/Design.Patterns.Demo/1.Creational/D.Builder/README.md)
- [Prototype](https://github.com/mf-rl/Design.Patterns.Demo/tree/master/Design.Patterns.Demo/1.Creational/E.Prototype/README.md)
